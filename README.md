# Linear-REgression-AR-VR-view-
created an AR/VR mobile application in Unity3D that can load a dataset derived from the numbers of patients
which the hospital staff took care of during previous years, then make a prediction of how many patients they could expect 
to receive in future. During a meeting, this kind of application can be used in combination with image targets on paper 
documents, thus enhancing the interactivity of a report by making things easier to understand and visualize in peopleâ€™s minds 
for funding and planning purposes. This served as an intro to mobile AR and VR for me using arkit and google cardboard VR 

main menu of application has functionality to input year to predict for,  
than a normal in game view of the resulting graph VR view AR View  device need ios 11 or higher
